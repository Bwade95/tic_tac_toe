# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple project to make a tic-tac-toe game with the core goal of this project being to minimise as much global code as possible by using 
Modules and Factory functions.

## How to Play
To begin playing you can choose to enter in names for player 1 and player 2 and then click play. Player 1 moves first followed by player 2 and you make
your move by clicking on a square on the board. Winner is whoever gets 3 of their markers in a row on the board.

## TODO:
- Add More Styling to the scenes and player name forms
- Add AI opponent
